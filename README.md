## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels across India, has been facing challenges in maintaining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. To address this, the management decided to implement "Business and Data Intelligence" to gain insights from their historical data and make informed strategic decisions. As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with developing a dashboard to help visualize key performance metrics and provide actionable insights for the revenue management team.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands has been losing market share due to ineffective decision-making and competition. Without an in-house data analytics team, they have outsourced the analysis of their historical data to identify trends, optimize revenue, and regain their competitive edge in the luxury hotel industry.

## Project Objectives

1. **Create Key Metrics**: Develop key metrics to monitor performance according to the provided metric list.
2. **Build a Dashboard**: Design a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders, enabling the management to visualize critical metrics and make data-driven decisions.
3. **Generate Insights**: In addition to the provided metrics, uncover additional insights from the data to support business strategy.

## Key Metrics

The following key metrics were created in Power BI:
- **Occupancy Rate**: Percentage of rooms occupied over a given time period.
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: The average revenue earned per room per day.
- **Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)**: The revenue generated per available room.
- **Cancellation Rate**: Percentage of bookings that were canceled.
- **Market Share**: Comparative performance against competitors in terms of revenue.
  
Additional custom metrics and insights have been developed based on data analysis.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes:
- **Occupancy Trends**: Visual representation of occupancy rate over time, segmented by regions and room types.
- **Revenue Breakdown**: Visualization of total revenue, ADR, and RevPAR by hotel location and category.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Comparative analysis of AtliQ Grandsâ€™ market share versus competitors.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analysis of guest demographics, booking behaviors, and cancellation rates.
- **Booking Trends**: Insights into peak booking periods, lead times, and seasonal fluctuations.

## Additional Insights

In addition to the requested metrics, the following insights were discovered:
- **Revenue Leakage**: Identification of underperforming hotel locations contributing to revenue loss.
- **Booking Behavior**: Trends showing high booking cancellations during specific periods, helping the team improve cancellation policies.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Analysis revealed opportunities for dynamic pricing models to maximize RevPAR during peak and off-peak seasons.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, metric calculations,creating the dashboard, data visualization, and insights.
- **Excel**:  For data extraction.

## Conclusion

This project provides AtliQ Grands with valuable insights into their revenue performance and market position. By leveraging data analytics, the management can make informed decisions to regain their competitive advantage in the luxury hotel industry.
